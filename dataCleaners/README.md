# DataCleaners contents

- `reivewer.py` - GUI for manual reviewing of collected data

- `findEmpty.py` - script that collects name of samples that have no mediapipe\leap data (as it is pretty common for the lib to have issues). Outputs toDelete_timestamp.txt file

- `deleteEmpty.sh` - bash script to delete entries with file name (provided in input file generated by `findEmpty.py`) from every trainingData folder

#### Note: 
I'm deleting entry in every folder and not just where the data is empty so I could train models on the exact same dataset.

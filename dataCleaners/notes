3 step cleaning process

after reaching 2k*11letters I've reviewed data three times

1. Delete data not containing anything (0kb)
2. Delete samples that does not contain any data in mediapipe datasource
3. Manual review

After every step I've filled up samples to contain the specific ammount (2k per every letter)
